# FLIM-CUDA-Primatives
Operations on fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) data performed on a GPU using CUDA.

The common folder from the samples is required to build these projects.
If you have CUDA 8.0, copy common folder from C:\ProgramData\NVIDIA Corporation\CUDA Samples\v8.0
and use the Visual Studio 2015 solution.
If you have CUDA 6.5, copy common folder from C:\ProgramData\NVIDIA Corporation\CUDA Samples\v6.5
and use the Visual Studio 2010 solution. (This is the latest version of CUDA for cards with compute <2.0)


For future projects, keep this directory structure, with your project 2 directory levels down.

The included template is from C:\ProgramData\NVIDIA Corporation\CUDA Samples\v6.5
